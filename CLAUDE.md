## Golden Rules

- Context is critical. Never guess how to use APIs or libraries.
- Use the context7 MCP tool liberally to get up-to-date documentation, and if that fails, use web search to find the correct usage.
- Don't make assumptions about APIs or function signatures.
- Clean up after yourself. Don't leave behind dead code, or other artifacts.
- Do not take shortcuts like mocking out functions to get tests to pass - we should be fixing compilation errors properly.

## Debugging

- In dev mode, someone needs to be running `npm run dev:ui` and `npm run dev:android` at the same time. This can be the user or yourself, but you should check it's one or the other. If you need to restart the dev servers, prompt the user to do so, or do it yourself if it's not already running.
- Our set up already includes a full Android emulator running.
- Do not try to run the app manually with `adb shell`, that won't work.
- We are usually running a dev server already, so you can just use `npm run test` for testing.
- When writing tests, check our existing test.spec files for how integrate android devices in playwright.
- You do not need to rebuild in development, just use `npm run test` and the dev server will handle builds for you.
- We are usually running a Chrome DevTools server on 9222, which you can query.
- Use `emu [start|stop|screenshot]` to control the emulator.
- Use `emu screenshot` liberally to help debug problems with the frontend and iterate.
- Use `npm run quickfix` frequently to fix linting and formatting errors.

### Debugging Build Issues

- **Tauri permission errors (e.g., "ankidroid-api.createModel not allowed")**: The most common issue is missing permissions for specific API commands. When you see errors like "Permissions associated with this command: ankidroid-api:allow-createModel", you need to:
  1. Add the permission to `packages/tauri-app/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` in the `permissions` array (e.g., `"ankidroid-api:allow-createModel"`)
  2. Rebuild the app after adding permissions - the dev server won't pick up permission changes automatically
  3. All available permissions are auto-generated in `packages/tauri-plugin-ankidroid-api/permissions/autogenerated/commands/` - each command gets its own `.toml` file. Do not write autogenerated files directly, just add them to the `permissions` array.
- **Kotlin/Rust changes not taking effect**: If Kotlin plugin changes don't seem to be working, the issue is likely caching. Clean the build cache with `cd packages/tauri-app/src-tauri && cargo clean` then re-run tests.
- **JavaScript client changes not taking effect**: The `ankidroid-api-client` package needs to be rebuilt after changes: `cd packages/ankidroid-api-client && npm run build`.
- **Force clean rebuild**: For major changes affecting both Kotlin and JS, do both: clean cargo cache + rebuild client package.
- **Error messages showing "[object Object]"**: This usually means error objects aren't being serialized properly. Add better error handling in the JS client to use `JSON.stringify(error)` for objects.
- **"Expected array, received string" validation errors**: Ensure Kotlin code converts split strings to proper JSArray objects using `JSArray().put(item)` instead of raw Kotlin collections.
- **Test page closing unexpectedly**: Usually caused by unhandled errors in the frontend. Add debugging to see the actual error instead of letting it crash the webview.
- Don't try to tap things using `adb shell input tap`, it's not reliable. Use proper tests and selectors instead.

## Project Structure

This is a Tauri-based Android app that provides an API interface to AnkiDroid. The project is organized as a monorepo with the following key packages:

- **`packages/tauri-app/`** - Main Tauri application
  - React frontend in `src/`
  - Rust/Android backend in `src-tauri/`
  - End-to-end tests in `tests/e2e/`
- **`packages/tauri-plugin-ankidroid-api/`** - Core Tauri plugin for AnkiDroid integration
  - Rust plugin code in `src/`
  - Kotlin implementation in `android/src/main/java/app/tauri/ankidroid/AnkiDroidApiPlugin.kt`
- **`packages/ankidroid-api-client/`** - TypeScript client library for the API
  - Built client distributed in `dist/`
  - Source in `src/`
- **`packages/emulator-management/`** - CLI tools for managing Android emulator
  - Linked as `emu` command; `start`, `stop`, etc.
  - Commands in `src/commands/`

The plugin architecture uses Kotlin `@Command` decorators in `AnkiDroidApiPlugin.kt` for the core functionality, not Rust.

## Project Notes

- We are targeting android only, not desktop.
- Our main emulator scripts are managed in `./packages/emulator-management`, linked to the `emu` command. Run `emu` to see the available commands.
- Update the emulator management scripts if you need to rather than running commands directly, so we can reproduce them.

## Misc

- The core logic is defined in `@Command` decorators in `AnkiDroidAPiPlugin.kt`. We are not using rust for this plusing.
- Always refer to "AnkiDroid" as two separate words for capitalization; E.g. `AnkiDroid`, `Anki_Droid` not `Ankidroid`.
